# Abstract
In real-world scenarios, environmental changes, hardware limitations, and image compression often affect the quality of infrared and visible images. These factors consequently impact the quality of the fused image. To minimize the influence of these factors and generate high-quality RGB fused images, we propose a novel teacher-student framework with degradation model for infrared-visible image fusion, namely TSDM-Fusion. In this framework, the teacher network is utilized to generate high-quality RGB fused images, while the degradation model is employed to generate low-quality infrared and visible images. Subsequently, the obtained images are used to train the student network, enabling it to learn the mapping from low-quality infrared and RGB visible images to high-quality RGB fused images. Experiments on multiple public image fusion datasets and $\rm \mathbf{M^3FD}$ detection datasets demonstrate that our method can not only enhance the visual fusion effects but also improve the detection mAP.
